Get-app-version-num
===================

Get a livecode apps version number at runtime.


This is for a desktop livecode application. 

This will save you remembering to change your about info every time you update your livecode version number, in the standalone settings.

You can simply call this function directly at runtime, in place of where you would have entered your version text in your about box
